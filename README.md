This is the second assignment for the course Native App Studio, called Apple Pie.

Apple Pie is a simple word-guessing game, each player has a limited number of turns to guess the letters in a word. Each incorrect guess results in an apple falling off the tree. The player wins by guessing the word correctly before all the apples are gone.
